### Meeting - (28/11/24)

1. Clarify the scope of the project. Is the project focus on the processing of SAR data, where I look at a challenge in the processing of UWB SAR data and aim to solve.
2. Is the intended solution a [[ML and DL techniques#Model Based Deep Learning|Model Based Deep Learning Approach]]?
3. How do I determine what is a suitable [[UWB SAR Challenges]] within the scope/timeframe/difficulty of the project? How do I know if I can feasibly find a solution to the challenge that was laid out.
4. Availability of data?
5. What is the relevance of the mmWave resources provided within the scope of the project.
6. Is there a specific algorithm/set of [[Synthetic Aperture Radar#SAR Processing|SAR algorithms]] that you think I should focus on or look specifically at? Frequency domain or time domain?
7. What implementation by interim report?
8. Clarify what is expected from the spring term meeting.

- Focus more on the fundamentals of SAR than thinking about specific problem solutions to problems.
- At this stage, the specific approach whether it is model based deep learning or signal processing is not important. Focus on problem formulation and not the solution.
- First develop a good foundational understanding of the background of SAR, and then apply these narrowband SAR models to the UWB case and see where aspects of the model breakdown, and where challenges arise.
- Consider the role of mmWave within this context.
- Try and find a specific challenge that has not been recognised in the literature, and begin thinking about the solution to these problem. 
- By the phase 2 meeting, a very good understanding of SAR is needed. This includes the ability to explain the SAR model, challenges caused by UWB SAR and some interesting solution to the problem.
- **Focus on SAR understanding at this stage**.


### Meeting (09/01/2026)
- Formula range resolution correctly in terms of the angle.
- Focus on FMCW SAR and formulate the wideband model. 
- Understand the challenges faced in UWB SAR written in a mathematical model.
- Formulate the inverse problem mathematically.
- Read and understand chapter 2,3,5 in Numerical Optimisation book. Potentially chapter 4 in the future.
