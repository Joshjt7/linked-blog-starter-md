**Definition**: Transmits data across a wide bandwidth (500 MHz) or at least 20% of the arithmetic center frequency

### Motivation
- The use of a large bandwidth allows the transmission of very short, narrow pulses in the time domain.
- A larger bandwidth allows for better range resolution.
- UWB sits in the sweet spot of offering low resolution radar whilst still supporting high resolution radar in close regions.
- Comparison to mmWave, FMCW.
	- Besides mmWave, UWB has the best potential for distinguishing small objects. However, increasing the bandwidth also has negative consequences since it decreases the max range for a given sampling rate.
	- The center frequency impacts the absorption rate of wireless signals by obstacles and air molecules. Lower center frequencies typically propagate further. UWB operate at a lower center frequency relative to mmWave. The higher frequencies in mmWave, facilitate high speed transmission, but severely limits the range.

### UWB Basics:
- UWB is a wireless technology that transmits sub-nanosecond pulses, resulting in large bandwidths, that utilises very-low power radio waves to communicate.
- There are some limitations and challenges associated with the application of UWB pulses that need to be addressed:
	- Complex radio channel, which can lead to significant signal degradation due to multipath and fading effects.
	- The characteristics of the UWB communication channel causes the pulse shape to undergo complete changes, including not just phase and amplitude alterations but also frequency dispersion.
