**Due:** Tuesday, 20/1/2026 16:00 Week 3, Spring

Refer to [[Project Scope and Development#Timeline|Timeline]] 
### Sections:
From the project guide:
1. **Project Specification:** What the project is intended to deliver.
2. **Background**: Review of literature, background theory.
3. **Implementation**: Technical work completed
4. **Project plan**: Breakdown of the work remaining.
5. **Evaluation plan**: How success is measured in the project.
6. **Ethical, Legal and Safety Plan**: Issues that need to be considered.

### Desired Structure
1. **Introduction:**
	- Outline the motivation of the project.
	- Describe the project specification and what the project explores and aims to deliver.
2. **Background:**
	- Outline the background of SAR.
	- Explore UWB model and explore the breakdown of the conventional SAR model.
	- Briefly describe conventional SAR processing.
	- Explore UWB processing techniques and methods. This is the bulk of the literature review.
3. **Proposed Implementation:**
	- Describe how I aim to tackle the project.
	- Why this is the chosen method and some introductory theory to the problem.
4. **Planning:**
	- Explain and describe the project plan.
	- Do the evaluation plan as well as the ethical, legal and safety plan.

### Background

#### Basics of SAR
- Conceptual ideas of SAR.
- Describe what is happening from a high level viewpoint.
#### SAR Model
- Present [[Pulsed SAR Model]] as seen in the literature and then explain the narrowband approximations used.
#### Conventional SAR Processing Techniques
- Frequency domain algorithms: Range-Doppler, Chirp-Scaling, Omega-K.
- Time-domain: Backprojection
#### UWB SAR
- Use the SAR model outlined previously to show why it is different and why conventional SAR processing techniques break down.
#### Novel SAR Processing Techniques
- Modified frequency domain algorithms.
- Deep learning.
- Compressed Sensing

### The SAR Model

#### Generalised SAR Model

#### UWB Challenges and Considerations

#### Other Important Considerations
