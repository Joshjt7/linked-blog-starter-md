- Definition of UWB:
$$B_f > 0.2$$
## Assumptions and Approximations 
- Approximated range equations.
- Narrowband assumptions
- Range and Azimuth decoupling
- Simplified range migration.

## Challenges in UWB SAR
- Traditional processing algorithms are no longer optimal. Need for new/alternative approaches to image formation.
