### Basics of Radar
- Radar can be described by transmitting an electromagnetic energy such as a pulse modulated sine wave, and detects the returned echo in order to extract information.
- The time delay, also known as the round trip time can be obtained as follows: $$t_d = \frac{2R}{c}$$
- The weakest signal that a radar receiver can detect is called the *minimum detectable signal*. Detection is based on establishing a threshold in which we assume a signal to be present if exceeded.
- In general a radar transmits and receives a train of pulses. We have the *pulse repetition interval* (PRI) and the *pulse repetition frequency* (PRF). The average transmitted power is: $$P_{av} = P_t d_t = P_t \tau f_r$$
