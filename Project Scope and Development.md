We are exploring UWB SAR. Conventional image formation/processing algorithms breakdown or are unable to produce high resolution images when UWB SAR is used instead of SAR with conventional bandwidths. Instead of traditional frequency domain algorithms, alternatives such as time domain algorithms are considered. These algorithms are able to generate the image appropriately, but are often of a much larger computational complexity than the frequency domain counterparts. There is interest around the research and development of better and more efficient algorithms able to solve this problem.

Traditional frequency domain algorithms:
- Range doppler algorithm
- Chirp scaling algorithm.

Time domain approaches:
- Variations on global back projection

Understand the challenges caused by UWB SAR. What are they and the relation to existing processing algorithms.


### Timeline

1. Autumn Term [[Phase 1]] – Project Problem Definition: Focus on understanding the project domain, reviewing relevant literature, identifying gaps, and defining the problem scope.
    1. Literature review summarizing relevant background and gaps
    2. Clear problem statement and initial project plan
    3. The 09/01/2026 FYP meeting is mandatory. Students should prepare a 15-minute progress presentation followed by a 10-minute discussion.
2. Spring Term [[Phase 2]]– Goal Refinement: Refine project objectives based on interim report feedback and initial explorations. Establish concrete research questions, select methodological approaches, and propose initial system or model designs.
    1. Numerical results for selected methods from literature
    2. Clear statements on refined goals, and potential innovation and contributions
    3. The 20/03/2026 FYP meeting will be a good opportunity for students to summarise their progresses and discuss possible innovations.
3. Pre-Submission Period – Implementation, Testing, Innovation, and Report: Implement and refine the project solution, conduct experiments or simulations, and highlight originality in methods or applications. The work should culminate in a polished, comprehensive final report.
    1. Final report including comparative results with literature benchmarks and clear statements on originality
    2. Draft presentation slides for a 25-minute session (15-20 minute presentation + 5–10 minute Q&A), with an evidence-based narrative demonstrating technical breadth, depth, and originality.

**Autumn Term:**
[[To-Do]]
- Understanding the project theory.
- Understanding the current literature.
- Defining the problem
- At this stage focus on SAR theory, UWB challenges without considering too much the approached (mbdl, approaches).

**Spring Term**
- Define the approach to the problem.
- Start designing the solution to the problem.

### Plan

	- Stanford Notes
	- Textbook
2. Develop the knowledge of challenges in image formation associated with UWB SAR, especially why conventional algorithms break down.
	- Research papers
3. Acquire some knowledge on how these challenges can be solved.
	- Research papers
4. Begin to structure the interim report
